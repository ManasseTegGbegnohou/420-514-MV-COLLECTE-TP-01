// mongodb-seed-got-real-100series.js
// Seed script for MongoDB (media_dev)
// - 3 users (admin, user, test)
// - ~70 movies (sample real titles)
// - 100 series (real titles list + Extra Series to reach 100)
// - For Game of Thrones: real episode titles for all 8 seasons
// - For other series: 5 seasons each with generated SxEx episode titles
//
// Usage:
//   mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017/media_dev" < mongodb-seed-got-real-100series.js
//
// NOTE: This file may be large but kept manageable by using placeholders for most episode titles
// and only using official titles for Game of Thrones as requested.
